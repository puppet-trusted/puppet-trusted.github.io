Those who use our Supported modules and the technology stacks they manage are often those best suited to know where to go with the moduleâ€™s development.
The Trusted Contributors program empowers these experts to make a difference with partial ownership of the modules in which they have expertise.

Trusted Contributors have the ability to help triage issues, perform code review and merge pull requests and, even make full module releases.
